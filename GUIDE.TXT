---<TinyAssembly>---
6502 assembly sub-set written in C89

---<Limits>---
No zeropage, its defined as absolute
No labels, branches and jumps uses line positions
No overflow, arithmetic uses from 0 to 255

Memory ranges from $0000 to $1FFF
Instructions are limited to 4096 per program
C, Z and N flags are available

---<Library>---
TASM_Machine: Struct that contains ROM, RAM, registers and flags
TASM_Open(char* File): Returns new TASM_Machine*
TASM_Close(TASM_Machine* M): Deletes machine and memory allocations
TASM_Execute(TASM_Machine* M): Executes machine
TASM_Debug(TASM_Machine* M): Executes machine, printing information and delaying with ENTER

RUN.C: Standalone executable, uses debug mode
DEMO.ASM: Testing program, fibonacci equation

"OPR" Implied
"OPR #VAL" Immediate
"OPR VAL" Absolute
"OPR VAL,X" Index X
"OPR VAL,Y" Index Y

'$' Hexadecimal value
'%' Binary value
';' Commentary, ignored by parser
